## TflosYOLO+TFSC: An Accurate and Robust Model for Estimating Flower Count and Flowering Period
- **Paper ID**: 2501.15262v3
- **Authors**: Qianxi Mi, Pengcheng Yuan, Chunlei Ma, Jiedan Chen, Mingzhe Yao
- **Published**: 2025-01-25
- **PDF URL**: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15262v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15262v3)

### Summary
Tea flowers play a crucial role in taxonomic research and hybrid breeding for
the tea plant. As traditional methods of observing tea flower traits are
labor-intensive and inaccurate, we propose TflosYOLO and TFSC model for tea
flowering quantifying, which enable estimation of flower count and flowering
period. In this study, a highly representative and diverse dataset was
constructed by collecting flower images from 29 tea accessions in 2 years.
Based on this dataset, the TflosYOLO model was bui...

## Flowers in graph-like spaces
- **Paper ID**: 2312.13825v1

### Summary
One perspective on tree decompositions is that they display (low-order)
separations of the underlying graph or matroid. The separations displayed by a
tree decomposition are necessarily nested. In 2013, Clark and Whittle proved
the existence of tree decompositions with flowers added in which, up to a
natural equivalence, all low-order separations are displayed. An important step
in that proof is to show that flowers can be extended to maximal flowers. In
this paper we generalise the notion of a ...

## Multi-objective Flower Algorithm for Optimization
- **Paper ID**: 1404.0695v1
- **Authors**: Xin-She Yang, M. Karamanoglu, Xingshi He
- **Published**: 2014-04-02
- **PDF URL**: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0695v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.0695v1)

### Summary
Flower pollination algorithm is a new nature-inspired algorithm, based on the
characteristics of flowering plants. In this paper, we extend this flower
algorithm to solve multi-objective optimization problems in engineering. By
using the weighted sum method with random weights, we show that the proposed
multi-objective flower algorithm can accurately find the Pareto fronts for a
set of test functions. We then solve a bi-objective disc brake design problem,
which indeed converges quickly....

## Resistance distance, Kirchhoff index, and Kemeny's constant in flower graphs
- **Paper ID**: 2007.03103v1
- **Authors**: Nolan Faught, Mark Kempton, Adam Knudson
- **Published**: 2020-07-06
- **PDF URL**: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03103v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2007.03103v1)

### Summary
We obtain a general formula for the resistance distance (or effective
resistance) between any pair of nodes in a general family of graphs which we
call flower graphs. Flower graphs are obtained from identifying nodes of
multiple copies of a given base graph in a cyclic way. We apply our general
formula to two specific families of flower graphs, where the base graph is
either a complete graph or a cycle. We also obtain bounds on the Kirchhoff
index and Kemeny's constant of general flower graphs u...

## Trees with flowers: A catalog of integer partition and integer composition trees with their asymptotic analysis
- **Paper ID**: 2402.16111v2
- **Authors**: Ricardo Gómez Aíza
- **Published**: 2024-02-25
- **PDF URL**: [http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16111v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16111v2)

### Summary
We present families of combinatorial classes described as trees with nodes
that can carry one of two types of ""flowers"": integer partitions or integer
compositions. Two parameters on the flowers of trees will be considered: the
number of ""petals"" in all the flowers (petals' weight) and the number of edges
in the petals of all the flowers (flowers' weight). We give explicit
expressions of their generating functions and deduce general formulas for the
asymptotic growth of their coefficients and th...
